#How To Talk About Data in Machine Learning

Data plays a big part in machine learning.

It is important to understand and use the right terminology when talking about data.

How do you think about data? Think of a spreadsheet. You have columns, rows, and cells.

The statistical perspective of machine learning frames data in the context of a hypothetical function (f) that the machine learning algorithm aims to learn. Given some input variables (Input)  the function answer the question as to what is the predicted output variable (Output).

Output = f(Input)

The inputs and outputs can be referred to as variables or vectors.

The computer science perspective uses a row of data to describe an entity (like a person) or an observation about an entity. As such, the columns for a row are often referred to as attributes of the observation and the rows themselves are called instances.

In the next lesson you will discover the principle that underpins all machine learning algorithms.
